    <p>This website is the Web Diploma major project at Hornsby TAFE. We are given a design and a couple of specifications that we are required to add into the website. We are only given the home page on mobile and desktop in the design, this means that we have to design the rest of the website ourselves. I have made this website responsive to work on any screen. You can test this by dragging your web browser from being large to small, you will be able to see all the elements of the website move around so that they work with any size screen.</p>

    <p>All of the products and product categories are being put into this website from a database in the backend. There is no hardcoded products or categories.</p>
